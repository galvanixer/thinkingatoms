Am I so impressed with Europe that I’m writing blogs about every little thing here? No, it’s not quite like that. It’s just my observation about animal behavior and how it differs so much from humans.

A few decades ago, a handful of white pigeons might have arrived here among a major population of black pigeons. Maybe they mutated genetically or migrated from somewhere — either way, it doesn’t really matter. Now, around 80% of the pigeon population here is hybrid. Most of them are white with a little bit of black, and vice versa. I can barely spot any pigeons that are purely black, and even fewer that are purely white. They’re all mixed up, and most of them are hybrids.

This situation reveals just how complex we are as a species. Well, it is called racism.

Now, let’s turn to us humans. Imagine a small group of purely black or purely white individuals migrating to a country or city where the majority of people are of the opposite color. Can we ever achieve a population with 80% hybrids like the pigeons? Sure, there are some examples of interracial relationships, but the question is, how many? This situation reveals just how complex we are as a species.

 *Well, it is called racism.*
