I’m sitting here having chocolate and realizing that it’s so boring and not at all delicious.
{{< /lead >}}
After growing up, chocolate just doesn’t taste the same. I remember when I was in class 9, a few girls next to my seat were sharing a big chocolate among themselves. It was melted, and I watched them break that gooey chocolate into pieces. It looked so delicious! I imagined its taste in my mind countless times. That younger me craved it so badly. Back then, having a chocolate was such a big deal. My brother and I only had chocolates on our birthdays—just a few times a year. I remember savoring one chocolate for almost a week, nibbling at it bit by bit. I didn’t want to finish it quickly; I wanted to enjoy every moment of it.

I think chocolates taste the best when we are poor or when we are fat. What an irony!

And then I grew up. I moved to another city to live alone and earn my own money. Now I have plenty of chocolates in my fridge—all brands and sizes—but they just don’t taste the same. Even the best chocolates are not that delicious anymore. 

It’s funny because *I think chocolates taste the best when we are poor or when we are fat. What an irony!*
