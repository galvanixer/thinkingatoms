Let’s start with this idea: “One should never be completely ignorant.” Why? Because being ignorant can sometimes cause us to misinterpret a lack of effort or understanding as cleverness or strength.

But, interestingly, there is a certain intelligence in being a little ignorant, just like every characteristic has its pros and cons. Ignorance, too, has its own minor yet positive sides. It’s a bit like accidentally overcooking a potato; that extra roasted, smoky flavor wasn’t the goal, but it brings a unique taste. Ignorance can have a bit of that same unexpected charm—though, like an overcooked potato, only in small doses.

So after thinking it over, I’d say, “There is a bit of smartness in ignorance.” Coming from someone who has experienced ignorance firsthand, I can definitely see this. One of the upsides? When you’re a little ignorant, you try because you don’t know. There’s a kind of openness that comes with knowing less than everyone else. Ignorance keeps us curious, and that curiosity drives exploration. When you’re not weighed down by everything people think they already know, you’re more likely to step into the unknown with fresh energy and ideas.

Life doesn’t work the same way for everyone. If everyone’s path is different, then what is truly right or wrong?

Another upside is that “you know less than those who believe they already understand everything about life.” And let’s be honest: some things people know about life aren’t necessarily worth knowing because everyone’s experience is different. What might work perfectly for one person could be useless or even harmful for another. Many things people think they know about life turn out to be of little use, mainly because life doesn’t work the same way for everyone. If everyone’s path is different, then what is truly right or wrong? When you don’t know these “set” ideas, you’re more open to experimentation, discovery, and finding new paths that might not make sense to others.

Ignorance not only pushes you to keep trying, but it also opens up worlds that most people haven’t considered. It leads to a kind of unique resilience. In a way, a touch of ignorance helps us see fresh possibilities and pursue new perspectives, reminding us that sometimes, not knowing too much is the best way to learn.
