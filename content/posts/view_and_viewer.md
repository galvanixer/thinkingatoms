This thought first came to my mind when I visited Nainital with my father, probably in August 2021, and since then, whenever I visit a beautiful place, this thought crosses my mind at least once.

Nainital is beautiful, very beautiful. The mountains are draped in a blanket of trees on all sides, and in the middle, there is a serene lake. Sometimes, the clouds descend so low that they almost touch you, and the lake is filled with such beautiful fishes and swans that if you start watching them, you might keep watching for hours.

Now, let me talk about the people who visit Nainital. Of course, I am one of them too. When I was in Nainital, I noticed that thousands of tourists come there from faraway places. Thousands of well-dressed women, wearing makeup, dressed in stylish and sparkling clothes, taking pictures in front of the lake. As far as you can see, this is the sight that you will witness — tourists dressed up, capturing their photos.

This makes me wonder: when we visit a place of natural beauty, do we go to admire nature’s beauty or to show off our own? Do we go there to become the beautiful view, or are we merely a viewer of the view?

Can we, by dressing up, truly compete with the beauty that nature has already bestowed upon the earth? No, right? Then why not, instead of going through so much hassle to dress up, simply sit quietly in a corner and enjoy the peace and beauty of nature? Isn’t this a better way to be a tourist?
