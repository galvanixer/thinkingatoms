excerpt: "When my little cousin brother joined army"

<center>

I salute royal dreams in sweet innocent eyes,<br>
Wish you a happy flight in boundless skies.

I salute royal path on which you want to fly,<br>
Wish you courage and passion that never-never die.

I salute every moment of happy childhood days,<br>
The paper-boat in water and sweet-homes of clays.

I salute love and care which never never end,<br>
My little sweetheart brother, my sweet childhood friend.
