Hi, I’m **Urvashi Sharma**, and I’m excited to welcome you all to **Thinking Atoms**— a digital version of my diary.
{{< /lead >}}

I am a materials scientist who is passionate about penning down her thoughts. Like everyone, I am a mix of contrasts. The serious side of me contemplates about  the inner workings of the world around myself, mixes chemicals to create unique morphologies of nano particles, and thinks about human emotions to make sense out of them. The other side of me is carefree and gets excited by little joys of life like blooming flowers, falling snow, and full moon. Seeing seeds sprout fills me with so much joy that I could cry, and good music makes me dance like crazy. When I can’t express my feelings, I write poems, and after a tiring day, I love to color anything I can find. Yet, around new people, I often feel shy and a little awkward.

Last year, I moved to Strasbourg, a charming town in France. From the day I arrived, I’ve felt nothing but gratitude for being in this beautiful place. This town more than anything gave me time and space to rediscover myself. Here, I planted my own balcony garden, gathered moss and ferns from the riverside and create my own terrarium, collected succulents and sedums from all over Europe and make them part of my little collection. I poured my heart into writing poems and reflections on life, while also reinvigorating my spirit by exploring new interests and learning every chance I got.

Now, I feel the time has come to share these musings with the world. Through Thinking Atoms, I would like to bring together my love for science with my other passions and connect with those who resonate with similar ideas. This blog is divided into four sections:
